        <h1>The Techno Optimists’ Blindspot</h1>

               <blockquote> <h2>Lies.</h2>
<i>We are being lied to.
We are told that technology takes our jobs, reduces our wages, increases inequality, threatens our health, ruins the environment, degrades our society, corrupts our children, impairs our humanity, threatens our future, and is ever on the verge of ruining everything.</i></blockquote>
This is the first paragraph of much celebrated blog written by March Andressen https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/

            </p>

            <p>
                This is not a lie.
                This is the diagnosis of what unfettered distribution of ad-driven digital technologies have done to the collective. Automation for the sake of reducing the share of labour in the production without regard to widespread job losses and displacement of workers have been the hallmark of technological advancement for the last four decades. The consensus view that short form video and its parent global scale social media apps have degraded mental health, assaulted liberal democratic fabric built painstakingly over the last three centuries and given rise to a class of technocratic oligarchs who are not that smart as they believe themselves to be is willfully ignored by the Techno Optimists.


            </p>
            <p>
                Blindspots are quite natural. What is worrying is such a wealthy influential caste; let alone address, but acknowledge the unintended consequences of their enabling. Some technocrats are shrewd enough to bargain a trillion dollar pay package, yet possess little intelligence to realise the debris their ego driven enterprises create in the wake of so-called progress. It's appalling to witness the collective disregard of this class to address the ills of hyper-automation-ad-driven-business model and instead focusing on amassing an obnoxious amount of wealth for themselves and their already rich shareholders.

            </p>
            <p>
                Technology, left to its own devices, creates winners and losers. The general view amongst the intellectual and the VC class is that deploying technology is a social good and in the medium to long term beneficial to everyone; i.e. capitalists, shareholders and workers alike. While I don’t subscribe to the luddite philosophy of ‘all technology bad’, I do believe  technologists have an ethical responsibility of weighing potential negative externalities their creation entails. The government, lawmakers, bureaucracy, workers, courts, civil society need to work together in building up regulatory state capacity to redirect technology into channels that generate growth and shared prosperity. The broad based sharing of prosperity is not automatic and requires countervailing forces i.e worker rights, legislation to curb monopoly, trade unions and a regulatory state. In fact for the first century of Industrial Revolution in Britain, the prosperity generated was concentrated in the hands of the wealthy capitalists, entrepreneurs and middle class while the working condition, wage, physical health worsened for most workers. The situation only improved in the second half of the 19th century when the collective bargaining power of the workers increased via trade unions, pro-worker legislations and regulatory interventions that eventually paved the way for profit sharing amongst workers.

        <h1>From the paper 'The Simple Macroeconomics of AI' by Nobel prize winner Acemoglu</h1>
        <div class="meta">
           <p>by Prajna Prayas <strong>Last Updated: </strong><time datetime="2024-10-22">October 24, 2025</time> </p>

        <h3>
            GDP growth in industrialized nations owing to AI induced productivity boost may remain under 1% over the next 10 years.
        </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Acemoglu says
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>
                            <p>
                                " I take Eloundou et al.’s estimates of tasks that are exposed to AI (without distinguishing
automation vs. task complementarities). I then aggregate this to the occupational level and
weight the importance of each occupation by its wage bill share in the US economy. This
calculation implies that 19.9% of US labor tasks are exposed to AI. I then use Svanberg et
al.’s estimate for computer vision tasks that, among all exposed tasks, 23% can be profitably
performed by AI (for the rest, the authors estimate that the costs would exceed the benefits).
I take the average labor cost savings to be 27%—the average of the estimates in Noy and
Zhang (2023) and Brynjolfsson et al. (2023)—and turn this into total cost savings using
industry labor shares, which imply an average total cost savings of 15.4% "
                            </p>
                           
                           
                           
                           <p>" This calculation implies that total factor productivity (TFP) effects within the next 10
years should be no more than 0.71% in total—or approximately a 0.07% increase in TFP
growth annually. If we add bigger productivity gains from Peng et al. (2023), which are less
likely to be broadly applicable, or incorporate further declines in GPU costs, this number
still remains around 1%."</p>
                        </i>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>
                    He also warns about the negative social value of AI in the current state if deployed for carrying out manipulative 
                    new tasks e.g misleading ads, deepfakes even if the increase in GDP raw figures is quite substantial.
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>
                           " New tasks created with AI can more significantly boost productivity. However, some of
the new AI-generated tasks are manipulative and may have negative social value, such as
deepfakes, misleading digital advertisements, addictive social media or AI-powered malicious
computer attacks. While it is difficult to put numbers on good and bad new tasks, based
on recent research I suggest that the negative effects from new bad tasks could be sizable."
                        </i>
                    </blockquote>
                    Later he puts a speculative number to the gain in GDP and negative social value attriutable to these
                    new (bad) tasks created by AI 
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>
                           " Combining these numbers with an estimate of the fraction of activities that may generate
negative social value (in practice, revenues from social media and spending on attack-defense
arms races in IT security), I suggest that with more intensive use of AI, it is possible to have
nontrivial increases in GDP. For example, AI may appear to increase GDP by 2%, while in
reality reducing welfare by −0.72% "
                        </i>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>At this moment, running ads seems to be the only viable business model

        <h3>On Economics</h3>

        <ul>    
            <li>
                Capitalism arises when the state (or any other coercive actor) leaves the individual alone.
The individual can make use of the “property” that they possess to carry out economic activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Companies with too big to fail status eg. JP Morgan, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs cannot be dethroned by an upstart if they compete in the exactly same business line.


            </li>
            <li>
                Stablescoins have the potential to reduce Big Banking making the entire ecosystem healthy by pruning these mega corps allowing breathing space to upstarts.


            </li>
            <li>
                The road to a developed nation is bumpy unless we improve upon a high quality number of jobs.

            </li>
        </ul>
          <h3>On Social Media</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The rise of social media has ushered in an unprecedented wave of mid-wit influencers who sound intelligent but splinter away at the tiniest of scrutiny. 
</li>
            <li>
                The truth is not important; it’s the falsehood; the effect of a sensational article laden with cherrypicking that changes the very mind of sensible people just a little towards radicalization, conservatism and outright fraud.

            </li>
            <li>
                It’s a cabal, where a handful of mostly midwit men in their 80s or their stupid sons and daughters holding executive positions at media companies nibble away at the liberal 
democratic order core to their rise in the first place.

            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile apps used to be utilitarian ; messaging, calculator, camera, navigation, email client etc. The rot started when apps broke into the intangible ether of human attention thereby venturing into the lucrative business of ads.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                On Artificial Intelligence
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Large language models with their emergent capabilities of aiding in professional services may be valuable to low productivity sweatshops like work. Whether it raises the average wages is unclear at the moment.

                </li>
                <li>
                    For an underdeveloped economy over reliant on a knowledge economy like India, this would translate to massive destruction in high compensation jobs. (Case in point  stagnant call center jobs)

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Sora app by ChatGPT maker needs to be banned. It’s the weapon of mass destruction. No age gating is going to work. 

                </li>
                <li>
                    This technology will drastically increase the difference amongst creators. The Big Influencers will license their faces to marketing companies for a fee. The real shoot for the ad will never happen. A 5 second ad would be generated. It’s possible the brand will go for the largest creator in their field with the second best guy starving for work. Physical shoots will become a status symbol. On the flipside, the indiscriminate usage of the said creators face will reduce credibility creating a vicious cycle.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Utility and utility-like companies say ticketing, e-commerce, logistics, power, energy etc will have razor thin profit margin. While luxury products sold with 40% advertising costs tends to have extremely thick margin potential.

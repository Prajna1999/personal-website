        <h3>On Economics</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Capitalism arises when the state (or any other coercive actor) leaves the individual alone.
The individual can make use of the “property” that they possess to carry out economic activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Companies with too big to fail status eg. JP Morgan, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs cannot be dethroned by an upstart if they compete in the exactly same business line.


            </li>
            <li>
                Stablescoins have the potential to reduce Big Banking making the entire ecosystem healthy by pruning these mega corps allowing breathing space to upstarts.


            </li>
            <li>
                The road to a developed nation is bumpy unless we improve upon a high quality number of jobs.

            </li>
        </ul>
          <h3>On Social Media</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The rise of social media has ushered in an unprecedented wave of mid-wit influencers who sound intelligent but splinter away at the tiniest of scrutiny. 
</li>
            <li>
                The truth is not important; it’s the falsehood; the effect of a sensational article laden with cherrypicking that changes the very mind of sensible people just a little towards radicalization, conservatism and outright fraud.

            </li>
            <li>
                It’s a cabal, where a handful of mostly midwit men in their 80s or their stupid sons and daughters holding executive positions at media companies nibble away at the liberal 
democratic order core to their rise in the first place.

            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile apps used to be utilitarian ; messaging, calculator, camera, navigation, email client etc. The rot started when apps broke into the intangible ether of human attention thereby venturing into the lucrative business of ads.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                On Artificial Intelligence
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Large language models with their emergent capabilities of aiding in professional services may be valuable to low productivity sweatshops like work. Whether it raises the average wages is unclear at the moment.

                </li>
                <li>
                    For an underdeveloped economy over reliant on a knowledge economy like India, this would translate to massive destruction in high compensation jobs. (Case in point  stagnant call center jobs)

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Sora app by ChatGPT maker needs to be banned. It’s the weapon of mass destruction. No age gating is going to work. 

                </li>
                <li>
                    This technology will drastically increase the difference amongst creators. The Big Influencers will license their faces to marketing companies for a fee. The real shoot for the ad will never happen. A 5 second ad would be generated. It’s possible the brand will go for the largest creator in their field with the second best guy starving for work. Physical shoots will become a status symbol. On the flipside, the indiscriminate usage of the said creators face will reduce credibility creating a virtuous cycle.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Utility and utility-like companies say ticketing, e-commerce, logistics, power, energy etc will have razor thin profit margin. While luxury products sold with 40% baloney tends to have extremely thick margin potential.
